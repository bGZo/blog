<p>So what the feel about above the sentence, while your friends or someone else could see that not existed page??? It&rsquo;s a serious question???</p>
<p>The reason why I wrote this article is that after Wikipedia was blocked, I deeply feel the domestic <del>the threshold of access to knowledge</del>The easy and flexible access to first-hand knowledge is high-CNKI, the libraries of various universities are not open to the outside world, and there are so few public resources. Most of the things I want to see are <code>404</code>, <code>The network has been reset</code>, <code>The webpage is reported to be inaccessible</code> various. Sometimes on the road of optimizing the network, the further and further, the more paranoid, because I can&rsquo;t figure this out of thin air The meaning of a threshold&hellip;</p>
<p>In contrast to the status quo in the mainland, there are no unpopular entries, or there are very few things + machine translation; the quality of CSDN blog stays between <code>Ctrl C/V</code>, [even the article of Script House can not be copied] (https:/ /x.com/xxxCg/status/1380159887158689796); The blog garden is half dead to make up for the vacancy of [review](<a href="https://github.com/cnblogs/cnblogs-">https://github.com/cnblogs/cnblogs-</a> hardening) a few years ago; those comparable to <a href="https://github.com/menzi11/BullshitGenerator">dog fart different generators</a>, there are more and more marketing articles that deliberately set up people first, and then collectively harvest them;</p>
<p>Like Wang Yin said, &ldquo;The great way is simple, what can be said clearly in one sentence? Where do you need articles with thousands of words at every turn? Occasionally I can see a flashing product, but it is destroyed in a blink of an eye. Zhihu, Douban, Baidu Tieba These are inseparable from one word- censorship. We speak of the Internet and illegal outside, but when the little butter in their mobile phones, the website was pinched, those people shut up again&hellip;</p>
<p>Most of the debates on the Internet are sophistry between those with vested interests and the general public, so there is no absolute error on which side you stand on. Life is so short, there is no need or meaning to hold on to one thing, although Countless predecessors have fought all their lives for Mr. De (<strong>Democracy</strong>) and Mr. Sai (<strong>Science</strong>), but life must be compromised. Please be happy friends, the world is not worth it&hellip;</p>
<p>I often feel contradictory when using Internet products, because according to <strong>nihilism</strong>, Douban, Zhihu, Weibo and Tieba** these things that carry the beautiful memories of our generation will eventually disappear**, then Should we use these products? It&rsquo;s really hostile to speak of. This is a heavy and serious question. I still can&rsquo;t let go of the &laquo;**Mr. Almost**&raquo; that disappeared from the NetEase Cloud Music rankings. , The disappearing &laquo;**South Park**&raquo;. Those **things I like, these platforms cannot carry **&hellip; How do I know when the data I hosted on it will be used&rdquo; Silently&rdquo; delete. I only know that the cat and mouse game will continue, and even more pessimistic is that I will not be the winner&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="memory">MEMORY</h2>
<p>Some people say <sup><a href="#j1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Internet censorship is common in all countries, and it does not only exist in China. At the moment when the global situation is not good for China, the authorities will filter out information that affects and endangers China&rsquo;s long- term development. At this time, national security is more meaningful. Significant. There are a large number of unrealistic, unobjective, and even self-contradictory statements that discredit the authorities and governments on the Internet. They are generally funded by Western governments or non-governmental organizations. These media include but are not limited to some Hong Kong media and overseas Website. We hope that when you encounter such remarks and opinions, you will not be incited without thinking, emotions were once incited and you cannot restrain and blindly believe in these one-sided or distorted facts, but think truthfully. , To get rid of the weird thinking of emotional kidnapping to understand.</p>
<p>We need to understand that the general tone of China&rsquo;s development is &ldquo;seeking progress while maintaining stability&rdquo;. The core issue of Chinese society is stability. China that loses stability will be a piece of sand, facing the danger of division and dismemberment. We hope you understand China today What is the fundamental guarantee for development, which part of the development process is the main theme, which is the noise; which is aggressive, which is the reverse of history. We should have a clear and comprehensive understanding of the problem, and be partial to the speech and lack of Western media Trust in the country is undesirable. Your data security and privacy are particularly important to you. If this information should not be held by the West, it is even more important to the destiny of the country and nation. For this reason, the authorities may restrict Your actions, we will not and cannot interfere with any policies and decisions of the authorities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people quote <strong>German Protestant priest Martin Nimora</strong>, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Germany, at first they hunted down communists, I did not speak, because I am not a communist;<br>
Then, they hunted down the Jews, I didn’t say anything&hellip;, because I’m not a Jew; <br>
Later, they hunted down the union members, I didn&rsquo;t speak&hellip;, because I was not a union member; <br>
After that, they chased and killed Catholics, and I didn’t speak&hellip;, because I’m a Protestant; <br>
Finally, they rushed to me, but no one stood up to speak for me anymore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I think: Everyone is very strange. Every day, a migration is repeated, entering the virtual world from the palm of the hand, and no longer pays so much attention to some shortcomings in real life. The virtual window blurs us and The distance of reality also gives us an illusion for no reason: the good life may be only a few pixels away from us, we may be kidnapped by the virtual world, or maybe not, the general trend is nothing. People who desire reality You can find some comfort on the Internet, and we are hoarsely proclaiming to live out ourselves, like a train without brakes, we who lack independent thinking, are lonely on our own timelines, and no one can save anyone. Or worse than nothing. I didn’t want to, shouting &ldquo;speed up&rdquo; and galloping down&hellip; For me, these missing things mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GFW Existed</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Is the rapid development of tens of thousands of households using the Internet in a short period of time the cause of GFW&rsquo;s unabated growth?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Memory</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Leave those 404s to <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> to remember.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Accept Fact</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Indeed, every country and place will have Internet censorship. As long as the world is peaceful and orderly, censorship will exist, but the degree is different. In modern society, you can only live in a world that is infinitely close to Big Brother, yes. One kind of ending is that in the novel &ldquo;1984&rdquo; at the end you will only fall in love with Big Brother, or comedy. But the most terrifying thing is that there is more than one Big Brother, you can also be Big Brother, and you who believe that Big Brother said at this time, just A handicapped tortured by this environment.</li>
<li>If I have to say something, just this sentence:
<blockquote>
<p>If the sky is not bright, then live in the dark; if it is dangerous to make a sound, then keep silent; if you feel unable to shine, then you don&rsquo;t have to illuminate others. But don&rsquo;t justify the darkness when you get used to it, don&rsquo;t be triumphant for your own stubbornness, and don&rsquo;t mock people who are braver and warmer than yourself. We can be humble as dust, not twisted like maggots.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Freedom / <code>Human Right</code></strong>:
<ul>
<li>We want the world to be peaceful and free, but in fact there will never be real freedom; is freedom in the cage still freedom? How should human rights be defined? How should the issue of political correctness be resolved?</li>
<li>The network realizes the classification of the user&rsquo;s identity? Are privacy, freedom, and free travel the Internet a basic human right?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Free Thought/Digtal</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Thoughts are at least free, at least there is no sin of thought, we can extend the boundaries of thought infinitely; unfortunately, no matter how detached your spirit is, you can never get rid of your body and live in the world</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Critical Thinking</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Google: A few years ago, I wanted to find a real-time traffic monitoring app, but I found that the app I got basically in China was not satisfactory, but I found it on Google Play in less than a few minutes. The same experience Google search also exists. Maybe you would say that I am a fan of foreigners, but I only agree with the first half sentence, I &ldquo;Chongyang&rdquo;, but I don&rsquo;t &ldquo;familiar with foreigners&rdquo;, because these are just tools. Although Google is an excellent global search engine, no one can beat it, but it happens to be It&rsquo;s American&hellip;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Update System</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Gradually, I turned off the automatic update of Win10, and started to find the version for the mobile phone to prepare for the elderly, back up the comfortable version of the application, and search for the old version of the clean application on Coolapk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>No Qualifications</strong>:
<ul>
<li>I may not be qualified to issue such a theory, because I am also a person with a vested interest. Using the Internet to learn better is the proof. If you have obtained something through the WWW, then you are essentially the same as me. I question the development of the Internet It’s as ridiculous as I questioned my objective existence. The contradiction has been resolved in a certain corner of the past, and the whole picture is only glimpsed today. The current era is destined to be torn apart between the opinions of others and yourself, no matter what you choose in the end, Please learn to forbear! Don&rsquo;t think this is something easy enough to forget, a knife on the head of Shinobu!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Past Network Environment</strong>
<ul>
<li>I miss the Internet environment very much, because there are people who can make friends for love, and any chat room on the Internet can make friends. Everyone is very friendly. Elementary school students are not derogatory terms. People who meet newbies will spend time with them. People really Talking with your heart, there is no chain of contempt, no war, no verbal abuse, no navy, but since the number of netizens has increased, the era of courtesy and courtesy has passed, and now it is necessary to quarrel and verbally say anything. I don’t even bother to reply, just read it as a joke. And now the forum still maintains harmony and harmony, it is a marginal fan forum. If you don’t pay attention, you will be deducted or titled. What you want to see is nothing, people still want If you ask, you will be honest. The biggest regret is that the children who were born in this era have passed away. After all, they missed a good Internet era. And that ridiculous joke is by no means just talking: <code>The four evils of Asia : Japanese devils, Korean sticks, Indian guys, Chinese squirters! </code>And my xenophobic psychology is actually normal, but it is not necessary. After all, the first day of the establishment of the WWW will inevitably lead to such a result, only now I really find it, a bit sad, but the power of connection It has been confirmed by the Internet time and time again, if you can&rsquo;t get out of this vicious circle, it will be helpless.</li>

<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s really afraid of is the gray area that technicians deliberately design and build and what they do more under the sheepskin of developing technology.</li>
<li>Denied and Delete of permissions are the same, you will never know the truth. It may also be that I can&rsquo;t keep up with the development of the times&hellip;</li>

<p>Let’s talk about interesting stories about using <strong>LAN</strong>, Chinese Internet features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MircoSoft Bing</strong>: It won&rsquo;t work if you don&rsquo;t introduce it, and it won&rsquo;t work if you introduce it completely. So in the case of Wikipedia DNS pollution, Bing China International can still call Wikipedia content layout from the server to its own webpage.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Onedrive+OneNote</strong>: As the supporting network disk of Office, it is blocked by the Chinese client, but you can still use the synchronization function of Office??? It is Office that synchronizes your data files abroad, but you don’t You can visit foreign countries to operate and edit your own files as fucking.</li>
<li><strong>Mega</strong>: A website with password privacy protection. Thanks to the built-in Chinese language support, Goose is useless. It looks like <code>Indiegala</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Android</strong>: Google&rsquo;s Android subdomain can be accessed, but the main domain name is blocked&hellip; and Google.CN can be accessed, but all the traffic is drained to the Hong Kong server, but of course it can be dumped to Hong Kong , Mobius ring? Because Google has withdrawn from China<sup><a href="#j3">3</a></sup>:</li>

<li><strong>Youdao Cloud Notes</strong>: The application already exists <strong>Internet censorship</strong>&ndash;Image recognition technology: Soon after I publicly shared the Youdao Cloud Notes of Google&rsquo;s withdrawal from China, the link went down and the corresponding picture was opened. , The returned <code>Json</code> contains the ID of the WeChat account of my note-taking software. The illegal picture in the note is not grayed out. It is not clear whether it is because of the cache or the person is visible. The ID has been exposed, and the Log must be there&hellip;</li>

<li><strong>Amazon/Evernote/&hellip;</strong>: The huge gap between international services and domestic services and the incompatibility of data quality inspections.</li>
<li>**bilibili: ** The following content is excerpted from the Data Research Bureau <sup><a href="#j4">4</a></sup>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Any macro- level videos, such as domestic industrial upgrading and international relations, are generally extremely optimistic. Basically, we are getting better every day, and the enemy is deteriorating day by day. Then as long as we hold this The speaker of the viewpoint can also be highly praised.</p>
<p>When it comes to the micro-level videos, such as housing prices or young people&rsquo;s fertility, etc., the barrage is generally pessimistic. Basically, it is either completely giving up lying down or venting dissatisfaction, and then anyone who tries to persuade others to be optimistic, saying that reality is not so Both scary and pessimistic speakers will be sprayed. ”</p>
<p>For another example, this user mentioned that in the video describing the grand occasion of Chinese Internet companies going overseas, the barrage is one after another excited &ldquo;Chinese companies are rising!&quot;. In the video complaining against 996, the barrage is one after another angry. &ldquo;Your grandfather worker is here!&rdquo; I don’t know if the young people at station B realize that the capital that makes them excited and screams about the capital is the same group of companies?</p>
<p>If we assume that the audience of the watch video family is fixed, that is, the youth group, then we will see such a peculiar phenomenon: while they are infinitely optimistic about the future of the country, they are extremely pessimistic about their own future. Because of their macro barrages The country is substituting, and the micro-barrage is substituting yourself. When substituting yourself, you don’t want to be optimistic, but naturally you can’t be immersed in fantasy in the face of a large number of relevant experiences. And the macro is too far away, and there are few such experiences. Naturally you can let your imagination fly.</p>
<p>**&ldquo;Grand narratives can be instilled, and the pains and joys of life are only known to you.&rdquo; <strong>In the words of the philosopher Eric Hoffer, it is: ** &ldquo;A person has nothing to boast about , The easier it is to boast about his country, religion, race, and the sacred cause he is involved in. &ldquo;</strong></p>
<p>At the same time, what we need to reflect on is: the development of the country is obvious to all. Why are more and more young people trapped in real life, slowly giving up the struggle, and lying flat? Why has this development of the country not actually improved The young people&rsquo;s own growth and living environment make them trapped in anxiety about their personal destiny?</p>
<p>In the long run, what is this potential risk? Those young people who fall into pessimism are more likely to be incited and deceived, because people with a sense of accomplishment will see the world as a friendly world, and those who are frustrated are happy to see The world is rapidly changing. Because there is always a tendency in human nature, that is, to look for reasons outside of oneself to explain one&rsquo;s own destiny.</p>

<li><strong>zhihu</strong>: The quality of the content has plummeted, and it is becoming more and more extreme. I think there are too many people who intend to use these platforms to attract (hu) and guide (you) netizens. Those well-intentioned words are incomparable. I heard that Zhihu has vigorously adopted the technology of intelligent recommendation in the past two years, which is very good. I think if a person refuses the information cocoon room, he will live in the house forever. Since I can&rsquo;t stop it Living with the advancement of technology, it’s better to learn to use it. Would you still insist on riding to the streets because you are afraid of car hitting the roadblock. Now looking back, you will miss everything you have taken seriously, and you will miss yourself at that time more. .</li>
