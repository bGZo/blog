## 📌 Thinking

### No emotion; no journal; less platitude

I have a habit of writing diaries in high school, to decrease the pressure and anxiety. So blog inherit it. As time going by, I realize I have to make a review of my life, in every single post, and it's really, kind of wasting time. Digging feeling or writing complain make every post like a toilet paper. Emotion and cliché may means a lot to the present, but less in the future[^3].

### No necessary to rewrite blog

You have to read old articles to find the mistakes one by one, even word alternatives, sentences order and font size or spaces. It's such a hell. So why not delete above all, then write a new one? Interestingly, this scenes sounds like *Bojack Horseman* wrote his first book[^7]:

### Show comments wontfix

1. It's really due to lazy, maybe a while, more likely wouldn't. 
2. I want this design being a filter to tired words in readers. Sounds like GFW we known, actually it's true. This design would be a soft-wall said by haohailong[^8]
3. People die, but long live github.[^4] However github is the third free services as well, like [disqus](https://disqus.com), [vercel](https://vercel.com) or something else. I don't trust them, free forever? Don't lie, nothing is free, sometimes it paid more than given. Backup as schedule is more reliability, and find a more sensible platform. Alternative is, creating it.
4. The function-added would be left to github, like action, comments, and more difficult problem in the future (;
