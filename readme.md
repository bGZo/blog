👋, I'm **bGZo**, encoding by base64, it's cool, right?

I like *coffee*, *open source*, *books(philosophy most)*, *musics(Instrumental Episode)*, *podcast*, *ACGN* and *running*.

Since Covid-19, little by little, I realized the precious nature of time with people we care most deeply about, which we always fail to recognize it until it's too late. The parents, firends, activities and cats more. Identify them. Prioritize them ruthlessly. As [@waitbutwhy](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html) written about relationships with parents:

> It turns out that when I graduated from high school, I had already used up 93% of my in-person parent time. I’m now enjoying the last 5% of that time. We’re in the tail end.

In recent years, when I look back the half of life, I'm not special, what I really want is being a normal person, with the loved ones. As [*The netscape dorm*](https://web.archive.org/web/20111128190028/http://uncrunched.com:80/2011/11/27/startups-are-hard-so-work-more-cry-less-and-quit-all-the-whining/) written: 

> I have no life. I never see any of my non-work friends, and I’m wasting away my one and only youth. I ought to be out doing fun things and active things, the kind of things I won’t be able to do when my mind and body finally decay. 

[@Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/todo.html) as well:

> Don’t ignore your dreams; don’t work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy.

So trying let coding make fun of your life, not just for a high salery job. Work for yourself. *Small is Beautiful, Less is More*!
