## üìå Thinking

### No emotion; no journal; less platitude

I have a habit of writing diaries in high school, to decrease the pressure and anxiety. So blog inherit it. As time going by, I realize I have to make a review of my life, in every single post, and it's really, kind of wasting time. Digging feeling or writing complain make every post like a toilet paper. Emotion and clich√©[^3] may means a lot to the present, but less in the future.

Since 20200501.

### No necessary to rewrite blog 

Based thinking 1, I decide to rewrite my blog, but it's more difficult. I have to read old articles to find the mistakes one by one. 

>"How about this word replace former? OMG!"
"How about if I swap those sentences? OHHH!"
"How about change the font size or spaces? AWESOME!"
...

It's such a hell. So why not delete all, and write a new blog?

Since 20210607.

### Wouldn't show the comments in blog

Firstly, it's really due to lazy, maybe a while, more likely wouldn't. 

You know, the platitude[^2] is kind of meaningless. I suggest using more clear and specific word to discuss. So I want this design being a filter to tired words in readers. Sounds like firewall we hated, actually it's true. 

On the other hand, as laike9m's blog written:

> People Die, but Long Live GitHub.[^4]

I agree github would live longer than me, which holds my posts, and your comments. Never use the third free services, like [Disqus](https://disqus.com) or something else. Cause they are lies, services are actually not free, sometimes it needs more from you. Github, Vercel as well, so keep to backup as schedule, and find a more sensible platform.

As function of like, dislike, keep this blog live long time, and more difficult problem in the future, would be left to github (;
