      <description>CHM? Yeah have a long history&amp;hellip;
 In 2002, Microsoft announced some security risks associated with the .CHM format, as well as some security bulletins and patches. They have since announced their intentions not to develop the .CHM format further, and will be moving to a new generation of Windows Help called Microsoft Assistance Markup Language in the Windows Vista operating system.

      <description>In general. I have finished the test of probability theory today. I still have a lot of regrets about the education I received, because I really didn&amp;rsquo;t learn anything. I always do a few sets of papers that my classmates want before the end of the semester, and then go directly to the test. , Without any own thinking and connection, I am always awkward.
  &amp;ldquo;Birthday Problem&amp;rdquo; / &amp;ldquo;Birthday Paradox&amp;rdquo;: The most interesting and practical part of this semester is the first class-introducing a simple problem mentioned in probability theory: &amp;ldquo;Birthday Problem&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Software Engineering talked about the main steps of Agile Development-Agile Development that I learned on TG a few months ago in the course, which I came into contact with in my spare time. Fragmented knowledge turned out to be embedded in such theories. I was sitting in the last row and looking forward. Although there were no seats, basically no one listened to this part of the content, let alone internalized thoughts.</description>

      <description>The app server is not available in your country.
The video is not available in your location.
The page is not available in your computer
 So what the feel about above the sentence, while your friends or someone else could see that not existed page??? It&amp;rsquo;s a serious question???
The reason why I wrote this article is that after Wikipedia was blocked, I deeply feel the domestic the threshold of access to knowledgeThe easy and flexible access to first-hand knowledge is high-CNKI, the libraries of various universities are not open to the outside world, and there are so few public resources.</description>
