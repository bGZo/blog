## 🌈 Where's Here?

It's hard to record pure knowledge without personal bias and nonsense broken words. In past several years I tried to separate life-feeling from here, moving them to `onenote/yuque`/`notion`/`wizi`/`phone stick notes`/`logseq`/`github`. Apperently I failed. What's worse, info was broken to pieces that saving diff platform. Maybe throw them to trash is better...🤯

Yet high net level required and unstable economical factor recently boreds me, I realized that the politics is powerful and seem like a huge elephant in the room. I never know what truth is. 🕵️‍♂️

Now I still think *fully using their natural feature* is best measure. Thus blog is just for archiving where the progress you've last done, diff with journals be rendered by rich-text. So the mature thought is suitable. 👻
